Abstract Factory
================
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Usage
- Use the pattern when you need to work with various families of related products, but you don’t want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products — they might be unknown beforehand or you simply want to allow for future extensibility.
