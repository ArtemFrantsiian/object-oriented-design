Decorator
=========

Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors into existing object by wrapping it into object that describes this behavior

## Usage
- Use the pattern when you need to be able to assign extra behaviors to objects at runtime without breaking the code that uses these objects.
- Use the pattern when it’s awkward or not possible to extend an object’s behavior using inheritance.
