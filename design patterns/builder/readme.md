================
Bridge is a creational design pattern that lets you separate object creation from object representation.

## Usage
- Use the pattern when the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled.
- Use the pattern when you need to provide similar creational process for several object representations.
