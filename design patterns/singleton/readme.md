Singleton
=========

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## Usage
- Use the pattern when a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients; for example, a single database object shared by different parts of the program.
- Use the pattern when you need stricter control over global variables
