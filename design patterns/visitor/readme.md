Visitor
================
Visitor is a behavioral design pattern  that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

## Usage
- Use the pattern when you need to perform an operation on all elements of a complex object structure (for example, an object tree).
- Use the pattern to clean up the business logic of auxiliary behaviors
- Use the pattern when a behavior makes sense only in some classes of a class hierarchy, but not in others
